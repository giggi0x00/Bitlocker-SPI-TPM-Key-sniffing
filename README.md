Bootloader and TPM speaks using different protocol such as LPC, SPI, I2C let's see how it works using SPI.

This project was ispired by  : https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/articles/TPM-sniffing. Thanks!

The SPI protocol works basically on top of 4 signals, SPI CLK, SPI MISO, SPI MOSI and SPI CS, the data goes in and out using MISO and MOSI and the slave is selected by pulling down the signal SPI CS.

SPI CS   <--------> SPI CS <br/>
SPI MOSI ---------> SPI MOSI<br/>
SPI MISO <--------- SPI MISO<br/>
SPI CLK  <--------> SPI CLK<br/>
<br/>

The communication with the bootloader evolved 4 lines, what we have to do is just sniffing the trafficing over the data lines.

First of all, we have to identify the TPM installed on the main board, in my case:

Pretty small. :)

Than if you look the TPM Specification you can see that the pinout is standard, so basically even if you don't have the datasheet of the chip you can still look at it.<br/>

Then solder some wire to the relative pins and start sniffing using a Logical Analyzer using at least 4xclock frequency in order to recostruct the original signal.

The command used by the bootloader to read back the VMK is "80h" and the address from where the data come out is the "0024h" TPM_DATA_FIFO_0, so what we have to do in order to get the key is looking a these specific command and address.
The VMK header is â€œ2C 00  00  00  01   00   00    00   03  20   00  00".
